# Business card

 A mini web app with business card theme that lets users create their profiles and present it publicly in the site's dashboard. This app is made to demonstrate a development with multiple tech-stack, covering front-end, back-end, and database.

 The project was made for learning purposes.

## Technology stack

The follownig are the technology/framework stack used for the front-end, back-end, DB servers with a brief rational for each selection. Some of the list might seem obvious but the target here is for beginners to learn from.
[]()
### For front-end (this repo): 
- [React framework](https://reactjs.org/) & React-app: not my favorite but simply the most popular, which means lots of references to learn faster.
- [React-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/): The most common responsive design framework.

### For back-end:
- Node.js: the only and great JS implementation for the back-end.
- Express.js: simple, and most common.

### For DBs:
- MongoDB cloud (Atlus): exteremly simple to setup and manage.
- Mongoose framewrok: Its more homogenous with the JS way than the offical mongo api.
- MongoDB server (deprecated, in favor of Mongo Atlus)
- Postgresql (deprecated, in favor of Mongo)

### others:
- MongoDB Compass: to monitor the cloud data locally (not important)
- APIs
- Git & GitHub: to better manage the code, make it more visible, colaborate with other, and I love open source.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
