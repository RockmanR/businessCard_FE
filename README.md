# Business card

 A mini web app with business card theme that lets users create their profiles and present it publicly in the site's dashboard. This app is made to demonstrate a development with multiple tech-stack, covering front-end, back-end, and database.

 The project was made for learning purposes.

## Technology stack

The follownig are the technology/framework stack used for the front-end, back-end, DB servers with a brief rational for each selection. Some of the list might seem obvious but the target here is for beginners to learn from.

### For front-end (this repo): 
- [React framework](https://reactjs.org/) & React-app: not my favorite but simply the most popular, which means lots of references to learn faster.
- [React-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/): The most common responsive design framework.

### For back-end:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org): the only and great JS implementation for the back-end.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): simple, and most common web framework for Node.

### For DBs:
- [MongoDB cloud (Atlas)](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas): exteremly simple to setup and manage.
- [MongooseJS](https://mongoosejs.com/): Its more homogenous with the JS way than the offical mongo api.
- [MongoDB server](https://www.mongodb.com) (deprecated, in favor of Mongo Atlas)
- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) (deprecated, in favor of Mongo)

### others:
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/):
- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass): to monitor the cloud data locally (not important)
- APIs
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) & [GitHub](https://github.com/): to better manage the code, make it more visible, colaborate with other, and I love open source.
