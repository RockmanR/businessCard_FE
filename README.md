# Business card

 This is a front-end server for a mini web app with business card theme that lets users create their profiles and present it publicly in the site's dashboard. This app is made to demonstrate a development with multiple tech-stack, covering front-end, back-end, and database.

## Technology stack

The follownig are the technology/framework stack used for the front-end, back-end, and DB servers.

### For front-end (this repo): 
- [React framework](https://reactjs.org/) & [React app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
- [React-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

### For back-end:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongooseJS](https://mongoosejs.com/): IMO Its more homogenous with the JS way than the offical mongo api.

### For DB server:
- [MongoDB cloud (Atlas)](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) (serverless): exteremly simple to setup and manage.
- [MongoDB server](https://www.mongodb.com) (deprecated, in favor of Mongo Atlas)
- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) (deprecated, in favor of Mongo)

### others:
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) & [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- APIs: the back-end, database, and any other servers are separated for modularity, and they communicate with their APIs.
